The project is about creating a model which predicts the flight fare price based on factors like distance, number of stops, total hours of flight as well as the type of seat

Here are the screenshots of working example on an AWS Linux Instance.

# Usage

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Man pages have been added. Checkout `man colorls`.


# Installation


[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Install git (preferably, version >= 2.0) and python (preferably, version >=3.6)
 [(windows)](https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-git-bash-on-windows/)
 For Linux :
 ```bash
    sudo yum instal git -y
    sudo yum install python -y
 ```
 
2. Copy the github url from the repository : 

 ```bash
 https://github.com/SiddharthaShandilya/Dementia_detection_using_AI.git
 ```

3. Select a Directory in local system and use 

  ```bash 
  git clone https://github.com/SiddharthaShandilya/Dementia_detection_using_AI.git          
  ```

    *Note for `git clone command`  Please make sure that you have proper internet connection. *

    *Note for `python` Please try to anaconda for running the app.*  

4. Create a seperate virtual environment to avoid conflict between python libraries :
```bash
    python3 -m venv new-env 
```
In case for anaconda we can use below commands
```bash
    conda create --prefix ./env
    conda activate ./env
```

5. Activate the virtual env: ðŸ‘‰ [(click Here)](https://www.programshelp.com/help/python/activate_virtual_environment_python_windows_10.html)

6. Install all the libraries for the application.
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
7. Once the environment is created use following commands to start
```bash
git init
dvc init
dvc dag
dvc repro
```

6. Have a look at [Recommended configurations](#recommended-configurations) and [Custom configurations](#custom-configurations).

# Custom configurations

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. In the project we are running flask application by using python3  which might not work so try below mentioned commands:
    ```sh
    python/python3 app.py
    ```
    or
    ```sh
    flask run 
    ```

</br></br>



# Recommended configurations

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)


You can overwrite the existing code according to your needs and changing them.

- Note :

1. Please have a look at the dvc.yaml file , Here i have used python3.7 version so if your console takes python3 to run python make sure to change all the commands in dvc.yaml file.

<br>

2. If any change regarding the file are concerned you are advised to change the config file in location ' /config/config.yaml '. For eg.. the location of dataset in thsi code is of a lcoal storage ../dementia_dataset, this might not be in you case so change the code accordingly.
